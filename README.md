Replication files for HIPGDAC-ES submited to _Scientific Data_.

The Historical Population Grid Data Compilation for Spain (HIPGDAC-ES) contains gridded population surfaces in GeoTIFF format for all census years from 1900 to 2021 in 100m x 100m and 1km x 1km resolution. Grids at 1km x 1km resolution are also offered in vector format in a GeoPackage database.

The data set is available at https://github.com/fgoerlich/HIPGDAC-ES in the HIPGDAC-ES folder.

The _R_ code that reproduces the results is `01HIPGDAC-ES.R` in the R folder using selected layers from the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for Spain (HISDAC-ES), HISDAC-ES folder, as well as other auxiliary information and census population data at municipal level in the data folder.
